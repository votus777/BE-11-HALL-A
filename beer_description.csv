54057142,Estaminet bière,Biere,"Direct answer: I found several beers named ""Estaminet"" (or L'Estaminet/Estaminet) from different Belgian and French brewers, but I could not find a beer exactly named ""Biere Estaminet bière"" as a single distinct product; therefore I provide descriptions and review summaries for the Estaminet beers located on BeerAdvocate, RateBeer, and brewery pages instead (if you meant a different specific label, please clarify). 

1) Description — Estaminet / L'Estaminet (generalized from listed entries)
- Style: appears most commonly as a Belgian-style Pilsner or Tripel from different breweries (examples: Estaminet Pils / Estaminet Premium Pils; Estaminet Tripel) and also as beers from French breweries using the name L'Estaminet for bières de garde or blondes/triples[2][1][4]. [2][1][4]
- Aroma: common notes reported include bready/malty and grainy aromas for the Pilsner, with some fruity/candied orange/peach notes for the stronger Belgian/French blond/tripel-type versions[2][8][4]. [2][8][4]
- Flavor profile: the Pilsner versions are described as clean, crisp, bready/malty with subtle hop bitterness and a slightly creamy mouthfeel, finishing dry and well-attenuated[2]. Stronger ales/tripels from breweries using the Estaminet name are described as fruity (candied orange peel, peach), moderately malty but not overly sweet, and full-bodied/dense in some reviews[2][8][4]. [2][8][4]
- Mouthfeel and body: Pilsner variants are noted as light-to-medium body with medium-high carbonation and a creamy yet crisp texture; the Tripel/strong ale variants are described as fuller-bodied and dense[2][8]. [2][8]

2) Review Summary — Common user opinions from rating sites (BeerAdvocate entries and product pages)
- Pros:
  - Pilsner (Estaminet Premium Pils) praised for being clean, crisp, easy to drink, with pleasant bready/malty aroma and balanced, subtle bitterness[2]. [2]
  - Many reviewers appreciate the creamy mouthfeel for the Pilsner despite its light body, and the clean finish which invites more sips[2]. [2]
  - For the stronger Belgian/French Estaminet-labelled ales, reviewers commonly note pleasant fruity esters (orange/candied peel, peach) and solid malt balance[8][4]. [8][4]
- Cons:
  - Pilsner versions are sometimes called a bit thin or not very complex — an easy-drinking beer but ""not much to it""[2]. [2]
  - Variation between producers: because multiple breweries use the Estaminet/L'Estaminet name, inconsistency in style and quality is reported across different listings, which can confuse expectations[1][4][7]. [1][4][7]
  - Fewer ratings for some specific Estaminet bottles (some BeerAdvocate entries show low rating counts), so consensus is limited for certain SKUs[1]. [1]

Description
- Style: Lindemans Faro is a *Faro* — a sweetened blended lambic style traditionally produced in Belgium (low–moderate ABV, light body, often made by blending aged lambic with fresh wort and sweetened with candi sugar). [6]
- Aroma: Reviews describe a malty, candy-like sweetness with brown‑sugar and lightly funky/lambic background notes; some reviewers note mild herbal/woody or earthy elements on the nose. [1][5]
- Flavor profile: The beer is commonly described as noticeably sweet (brown sugar/candi sugar character) balanced by a restrained lambic acidity so the result is fruity, moderately acidic but overall sweet; tasting notes mention dextrinous/medium body, fine carbonation and a slightly bitter/woody finish in some takes. [1][5]
- Mouthfeel & ABV: Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and somewhat dextrinous with fine, moderate carbonation that gives a light tingle before a smooth finish; Lindemans Faro sits at a low–moderate ABV typical of modern faros (sources reviewing the beer indicate the style’s ABV range 2.0–5.0%). [1][6]

Review summary (common user opinions from rating sites)
- Pros:
  - Many reviewers praise its *approachable sweetness* — pleasant for drinkers who find straight lambic too sour, with agreeable brown‑sugar/candy character and balanced acidity.[1][5]
  - Considered an easy, sessionable lambic variant: light-to-medium body, fine carbonation, and drinkable sweetness make it a good “change of pace.”[1][6]
- Cons:
  - Some find it *too sweet* or *cloying* compared with more traditional, tart lambics — fans of sharp sourness may prefer unsweetened lambics.[1][4]
  - A few note it lacks the depth or intense funk of higher‑end or more traditional lambics, and describe an off‑dry/woody or mildly herbal aftertaste that not everyone enjoys.[1][5]
- Typical ratings: BeerAdvocate user ratings for Lindemans Faro place it in the solid-to-good range with examples around the mid-to-high 3.x out of 5 (user reviews highlight both enjoyment for its sweetness and disappointment from those seeking more sour/funky character).[1]

1) Description
- Style and production: Bourgogne des Flandres is a Flemish red‑brown (oud bruin / Flanders red/brown style) produced in Bruges by Brasserie Bourgogne des Flandres; it is made by *mixed fermentation* — blending a young top‑fermented beer with spontaneously fermented lambic components and sometimes aged in oak — giving the beer its characteristic balance of sweet and sour notes[5][2][4].[5][2][4]

- Aroma: Common descriptions note a malted, lightly roasted/mildly toasty malt aroma with caramel and dark/black fruit notes and light woodiness from barrel ageing[2][3][9].[2][3][9]
- Flavor profile and mouthfeel: The attack is described as malt‑sweet and rounded, with noticeable carbonation for refreshment, followed by a combination of brown‑sugar/caramel sweetness, red/black fruit esters and a *pleasant acidic/sharp* edge (vinegary or lactic-like sourness) that delivers a dry, slightly astringent finish; hop bitterness is present but typically low to moderate[1][2][3][10].[1][2][3][10]

Pros:
- Balanced sweet‑and‑sour profile: Many descriptions praise the interplay of caramel/malt sweetness with a clean, refreshing acidity that keeps the beer lively rather than cloying[1][8][10].[1][8][10]

Cons:
- Some find the acidity/“vinegary” edge sharper than expected — what fans call refreshing can be off‑putting to drinkers who prefer straightforward malty or hoppy beers[10][1].[10][1]
- Relative subtlety: A few descriptions imply it is not as intensely sour or funky as some dedicated lambics/old ales, so enthusiasts seeking extreme sourness or big Brett funk may consider it tame[8][9].[8][9]

- Consensus: generally well regarded as a distinctive, fruit‑forward yet aged/blended kriek — award‑winning at several competitions according to brewery/retailer notes — appreciated for its cherry intensity and balanced acidity, though sweetness and bottle age affect individual impressions[3][2][7].

Essential context: I searched BeerAdvocate, RateBeer, and brewery websites for a beer named exactly ""nan Faro"" but found no match for that exact name; the searches instead returned multiple entries for beers simply called ""Faro"" from various Belgian breweries (Timmermans, Lindemans, Cantillon, 3 Fonteinen, Mort Subite, Van Honsebrouck, etc.), but nothing labeled ""nan Faro"" on BeerAdvocate or in brewery listings[1][2][4][7][8].  

Relevant supporting details:
- BeerAdvocate has separate pages for several Faro beers (e.g., Timmermans Faro, Lindemans Faro, Cantillon Faro, 3 Fonteinen Faro, Mort Subite Faro, St. Louis Premium Faro) describing the Faro style and individual flavor notes, but none use the name ""nan Faro""[1][2][4][7][8][5].  
- The Faro style is a Belgian blended lambic typically sweetened with candi sugar, light-bodied, mildly acidic, and often low ABV (about 2–5%); BeerAdvocate’s Faro style page summarizes these characteristics[6].  

Because you asked for a description and review summary specifically for ""nan Faro,"" and that exact beer name could not be found in the specified sources, I must report ""정보 없음.""

Review Summary (common user opinions — pros / cons):  
- Pros: Many users praise the successful fusion of roasted dark-malt flavors with aggressive West Coast hop bitterness, calling out coffee, chocolate and caramel notes balanced by citrusy/herbal hops and lively bottle-conditioning; the beer’s complexity and drinkability despite high ABV are frequently noted[2][6][9].  
- Cons: Common negatives are that the roast can be intense or “stouts-like” for hop-focused drinkers, bitterness may be too strong or astringent for some, and variability in ABV/description across listings causes occasional confusion about the exact strength (8.5% vs 9.2%)[8][4][1].  
- Consensus: Overall user ratings (Untappd and beer sites) indicate this is popular among drinkers who enjoy dark IPAs or robust Belgian-strong beers with a hoppy edge, but it may not suit those seeking a restrained or purely malt-forward dark ale[6][2].

If you want further searching beyond these results, say so. [1]

1) Description
- Style: Belgian winter ale / winter warmer (entry identifies it as a Belgian winter-style beer). [1]
- Aroma: Spicy and warming character is noted, consistent with Belgian winter/spice-driven aromatics. [1]
- Flavor profile: Moderate bitterness with alcohol that is noticeable as warming but not overt in taste; overall spicy and warming malt/yeast character expected for a winter ale. [1]
- Mouthfeel: Medium body with a bubbly (effervescent) carbonation level. [1]

2) Review summary (common user opinions from rating sites)
- Pros: Users praise it as a “nice Belgian winter ale,” highlighting its spicy, warming profile, balanced moderate bitterness, and medium/bubbly mouthfeel; alcohol is present as warmth rather than a sharp boozy taste.[1]

Context and supporting details:
- I searched BeerAdvocate and found multiple Malheur entries from Brouwerij De Landtsheer (Malheur 12 / Malheur 12° / Malheur Dark / Malheur Brut variants), all Belgian beers around 12% ABV, but none matching the exact name ""nan Cerveza Artesana Malheur 12 12%"".[1][9][4]
- The brewery's official site lists Malheur beers (Malheur 10, Malheur 12 and other variants) under Brouwerij De Landtsheer / Malheur, confirming the brand and a 12°/12% Malheur variant, but there is no listing that includes the phrase ""nan Cerveza Artesana.""[3]
- RateBeer results were not returned in the search results provided; BeerAdvocate and retailer pages describe Malheur 12 as a strong (≈12% ABV) Belgian-style dark/champagne-like beer with rich dark-fruit, caramel/toffee and chocolate notes, a big head, and good carbonation — these descriptions match Malheur 12 entries on BeerAdvocate and specialty beer sites but do not include the ""nan Cerveza Artesana"" wording.[9][1][4]

- Pros: Many users praise its strong, authentic peach character, refreshing drinkability, low ABV (good for sessioning), and the pleasant interplay of peach sweetness with lambic tartness/funk[7][3][4].  
- Cons: Critics mention it can be overly sweet for some, the fruit masks complex lambic character for traditional lambic fans, and opinions vary on how much funk is desired—some find it slightly one‑dimensional compared with straight gueuze[2][7][4].  
- Overall consensus on rating sites: generally liked as a fruity, easy‑drinking peach lambic—popular with fruit‑beer drinkers and casual tasters, less so with purist lambic enthusiasts who prefer drier, more complex gueuzes[7][2][4].

Context and supporting details:
- BeerAdvocate lists several Brasserie Piedboeuf / Jupiler entries (Jupiler standard, Jupiler Blue, Jupiler NA) with tasting notes describing a light, grainy Belgian pilsner/lager profile (dry, light yellow, grassy/bready aroma, mild bitterness) which match Jupiler branded beers but do not reference ""Chockies Group"" or that exact combined name[1][2][9].  
- Untappd and retail listings show various Piedboeuf-branded beers (e.g., Piedboeuf Bruin Foncée, Piedboeuf Tripel, Piedboeuf blond table beer) produced by Brasserie Jupiler / Piedboeuf, but none are titled ""Jupiler (Chockies Group) Piedboeuf"" or indicate a ""Chockies Group"" association[3][5][6].  
- News about the Piedboeuf/Jupiler brewery (AB InBev reissues such as Piedboeuf Extra Pils) discusses Piedboeuf as a historic brand within the Jupille/Piedboeuf family but does not mention ""Chockies Group""[4].

Review-summary (from rating-site material for Jupiler / Piedboeuf beers generally):
- Common positive points: drinkable, crisp/dry pilsner character; balanced light grassy/bready aroma; approachable everyday lager qualities[1][2].  
- Common negative points: perceived as watery or lacking distinct flavor complexity; some variants (e.g., Jupiler NA or weaker table beers) receive criticism for off or thin aromas and bland taste from some users[1][3][9].

Description:

- Production note: some descriptions and retail listings note oak barrel maturation (reported ~18 months) contributing to its vinous, barrel-aged character.[3]

Review summary (BeerAdvocate, RateBeer and brewery/retail commentary):
- Common positives: reviewers frequently praise Bacchus for being a well-executed, approachable Flemish oud bruin with a pleasing balance of sweet and sour, good vinous/wine-like complexity, and refreshing carbonation that makes it a good intro to sour/Flanders styles.[1][4][5]
